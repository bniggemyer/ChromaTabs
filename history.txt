HISTORY

v3.0.0 beta 1

- Added support for Firefox 4.x but no longer supports Firefox 3.x.  It would have been too confusing and time-consuming to maintain two different interfaces.  Use version 2.3.0 for Firefox 3.6.x.
- Removed choice of solid or clear "close tab" buttons.  Now reverts to the Firefox default which is clear in FF4.
+ To integerate better with translucent Firefox 4 themes, the tab backgrounds can now be solid, transparent, or anywhere in between.

v2.3.0

+ Added tolerance when calculating "most frequent" color.  For example, the Google icon should now be green instead of grey.
+ Separate opacity/saturation/luminosity values for selected tab, unselected tab, active tab (on mouseover)
+ Added option to do nothing if a site icon is missing. The alternative would be to pick a color unique to the site's domain name.
+ When coloring based on domain name, offer the option for different subdomains to share the same tab color.
+ FIXED: "color is null" error message
+ FIXED: No longer need to restart browser (and clear session) or hover over all tabs for new appearance settings to take effect.

v2.2.0

+ Option to use the most frequent color in the image.  If the results are inconclusive (rare), then it uses the old method of taking the average.
+ Defaults to favicon-based tab colors.
+ Transparent close-tab buttons
+ Colorized border between page and tabs when using the Tree Style Tab extension
+ FIXED: When starting firefox w/ a restored session, only the active tab gets colored.  Other tabs become colored on mouseover.
+ FIXED: New tabs are not colored immediately after using "Open link in new tab"
